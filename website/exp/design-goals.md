# Design Goals

subpatch is designed based on the following goals. The tool subpatch

1. minimizes complexity compared to other tools
2. does not interfere with the vcs
    1. is distributed (as in git)
    2. allows nesting
3. allows local patching/forking of subprojects
4. is vcs agnostic, but integrates with the vcs
5. does not mix build tool and vcs
