# Requirements

I based subpatch on my experiences and learnings as a (embedded) software
engineer. Everything that I have seen and done in the last ten years feeds into
the following list of requirements. See the [history page](history.md) for
details.

*NOTE*: For now the implementation of subpatch not complete. Please read the
requirement list as a vision for the first major release of subpatch, not as a
status of the implementation.


## List of requirements

The tool â€¦

(**R1**) should support git, cvs, mercurial, subversion and non-cvs environment
as superprojects.

(**R2**) do not interfere with the vcs. The existing workflows
like checking out, cloning, switching branches, updating, rebasing, tagging,
forking, bisecting, releasing and ... should stay the same.

(**R3**) should support git, cvs, mercurial, subversion and source
code archives (like tarballs or zip files) as source dependencies/subprojects.

(**R4**) should track the original metadata (e.g. url, commit ids,
checksums, ... ) of the source dependency to verify the authenticity of the
dependency later.

(**R5**) should help integrating updates of the source dependencies.

(**R6**) should support local patching of source dependencies.

(**R7**) If the source dependency is patched locally, it should help
maintaining a linear patch stack.

(**R8**) should rebase local patches automatically, when doing an update of a
source dependency and there are *no conflicts* with the local patches.

(**R9**) should help porting the local patches, when doing an update of a
source dependency and there are *conflicts* with the local patches.

(**R10**) should provided an stable command line API (plumbing commands) to
support other tools to track source dependencies, e.g. to automatically check
for updates or for CVEs.

(**R11**) should support every development platform that also supports git and
python, like Linux, unixes, Windows and MacOS.

(**R12**) should scale to the size of the AOSP (Android Open Source Project).

## Conclusion

The list of requirements is the design goal of subpatch. It describes the
properties and capabilities an implementation should fulfil and provide for its
users.
